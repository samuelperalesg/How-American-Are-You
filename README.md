# _How American Are You?_

## Description:
###  In this game the user will be quizzed on their knowledge of US History. These questions are based on the citizenship test that many foreigners have to take before becoming a citizen of the United States. The user will be given the option to select one of the four quizzes to play. There are 25 questions in each quiz but only 10 will be randomly generated for the user to see and play. The user will win if all the answers are chosen correctly. 

## Background:
### I chose this game because my mother is currently a permanent resident here in the United States. She will soon have to apply for citizenship but she has not studied for the test that many take to become a citizen of the United States. There are 100 questions that the US believes are important for the test but only a few are asked when tested. This means my mom will have to know all 100 answers so that she is not tripped up during testing to become a citizen. I have created this game for her and for people like her who also need to study. I hope that this game will help anyone that needs it.
